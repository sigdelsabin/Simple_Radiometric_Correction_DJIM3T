# Simple_Radiometric_Correction_DJIM3T

This is a simple demonstration of the use of dji_irp.exe inside the DJi_thermal_SDK for the conversion of the raw thermal images to .tif.

We are not using exiftool and the other applications inside the DJI_thermal_SDK. Please use them to see the metadata and to copy the metadata.

You can download the DJI_thermal_SDK latest version and the exiftool for free in their respective website. Just google it.
